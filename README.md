# [Week-05](https://github.com/CavalloFede/BaSP-2023/tree/master/Week-05)

This is the assignment for the fifth week of the Bootcamp

`This week, I worked on a series of exercises to learn JavaScript. The exercises covered a range of topics, including variables and operators, strings, arrays, if-else statements, for loops, and functions.`

You can view a preview of the page via its link on the Github page [here](https://cavallofede.github.io/BaSP-2023/Week-05/)

# Exercise Topics

## Variables and Operators

This exercise focused on the basics of JavaScript variables and operators. I learned about different variable types (such as strings, numbers, and booleans), how to declare and assign variables, and how to use arithmetic operators (+, -,\*, /) and comparison operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=) to perform basic operations.

## Strings

In this exercise, I learned about JavaScript strings and how to manipulate them. I learned how to create strings, how to concatenate them with the + operator, and how to access individual characters within a string using bracket notation. I also learned about some common string methods, such as length(), indexOf(), and slice().

## Arrays

This exercise focused on JavaScript arrays, which are used to store collections of values. I learned how to create arrays, how to access individual elements using bracket notation, and how to use common array methods such as push(), pop(), shift(), and unshift() to add or remove elements from an array.

## If-Else

This exercise introduced the concept of control flow in JavaScript, specifically the if-else statement. I learned how to use if-else statements to perform different actions based on different conditions. I also learned about the logical operators && (and), ||(or), and ! (not), which can be used to combine multiple conditions.

## For Loops

For loops are a type of loop in JavaScript that allow you to perform a set of actions a certain number of times. In this exercise, I learned how to use for loops to iterate over arrays, to count from one number to another, and to perform other repetitive tasks.

## Functions

Functions are a fundamental building block of JavaScript, and in this exercise, I learned how to define and use functions. I learned how to create functions, how to pass arguments to functions, and how to use return statements to return values from functions.

# [Week-06](https://github.com/CavalloFede/BaSP-2023/tree/master/Week-06)

This is the assignment for the sixth week of the Bootcamp

`This project was created as part of week 6 of a bootcamp to create a login and register page for a gym website. The main goal was to use HTML, CSS, and JS to create interactive pages that allow users to register and log in. This project does not store user information, it only verifies that input fields are valid and displays error messages if they are not.`

You can view a and use the page via its link on the Github page [here](https://cavallofede.github.io/BaSP-2023/Week-06/views/)

## Technologies Used

This project was created using the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Functions Used

This project utilizes functions to validate that all data passed validation. These functions check that the input fields contain the correct type of data (e.g., email address, password), and displays error messages if the input is invalid.

## Navigation

This project has implemented navigation between the login and register pages using buttons and hyperlinks. Users can move back and forth between the pages by clicking on the appropriate buttons.

# [Week-07](https://github.com/CavalloFede/BaSP-2023/tree/master/Week-07)

This is the assignment for the seventh week of the Bootcamp

`This project was created as part of week 7 of a bootcamp to extend the functionality of the login and register pages created in week 6. The main goal was to use JavaScript to send form data to a web server via an HTTP request, only if the input data passes validation. If the HTTP request is successful, the server responds with the data that was sent, and the client displays a success message. If the HTTP request fails, the client displays an error message.`

You can view the page via its link on the Github page [here](https://cavallofede.github.io/BaSP-2023/Week-07/views/)

## Technologies Used

This project was created using the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## HTTP Request

This project utilizes JavaScript's Fetch API to send an HTTP request to the server, passing form data as query parameters. The server responds with a success or error message, which is then displayed on the client side.

## LocalStorage

For the Signup page, this project utilizes LocalStorage to store the data obtained from a successful HTTP request. The stored data is then loaded into the corresponding input fields when the page is refreshed.
